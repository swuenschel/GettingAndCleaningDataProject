# GettingAndCleaningDataProject
##Week 4 project for course Getting and Cleaning Data
  This data analysis project accesses the UCI Machine Learning data set:
  Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. A Public Domain Dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones. 21th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning, ESANN 2013. Bruges, Belgium 24-26 April 2013.

##There are two scripts included in this repository:
  1. Getting.R  downloads the data files, unzips, and calls
      the function run_analysis.R
  2. run_analysis.R  processes the test and training data sets
      into a single data set and summarizes the means of all 
      variables with "mean" or "std" in the UCI defined name

Activity and derived variable names are explained in the README.txt file that is downloaded 
  in the Getting.R script.
