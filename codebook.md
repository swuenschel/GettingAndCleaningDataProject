The data and all preprocessing methods are described fairly well in the README.txt that downloads with the data files from the UCI Machine Learning lab website. However, a few notes and summaries are useful past what is provided by the UCI data set. 

1. The X-test and X-train data files contain the preprocessed data sets.  The Y-test and Y-train files contain the activity codes for each line of the corresponding "X" file. The activities are walking, laying down, etc. and are described more fully in the data set documentation. The subject-test and subject-train data files similarly contain the test subject identifier for 
  each line of the corresponding "X" file. 
  
2. The data descriptor for each column in the "X" file can be found in the data file feature.txt found in the parent directory. 
  
3. The test data set files (X, Y, and subject) were combined into a single data table.  The training files were similarly combined. The test and training sets were then combined into a total set and the standard deviation and mean data members extracted.  This data set was summarized by calculating the mean value for each metric grouped by test subject/activity combination. Two redundant data tables are provided because I got the aggregate method working first but wanted to practice chaining.  The data is identical though the output format is slightly different (matrix vs grouped data table).
